# Class 4: Naive Bayes from scratch

Note: Changes to this plan may occur

### TL:DR
 - Required:
   - Make sure you have a working `Text` class which are able to return n-grams of a given text as well as a token frequencies.
   - Increase your understanding of Naive Bayes classification, as an addition to the reading I would recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2L2Uv9pdDA).
 - Optional
   - read the paper:[Idiot's Bayes: Not So Stupid after All?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1403452?origin=crossref&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
   - read the paper: [The Optimality of Naive Bayes](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~hzhang/publications/FLAIRS04ZhangH.pdf)



We will be implementing Naive Bayes in the class or at least get started doing it. To make the it easy to follow please make sure you have a good understanding of the Naive Bayes classification. In addition to the reading I personally recommend the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2L2Uv9pdDA) by Josh Starmer on his youtube channel statquest. This is in general a highly recommended channel
