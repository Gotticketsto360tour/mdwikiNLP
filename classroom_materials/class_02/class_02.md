# Class 2: Basic Packages and Modules
**The plan for the class is still a work in progress.**


### TL:DR
 - Required:
   - Download the Danish and English model for Stanza prior to class
   - Make sure you have everything set up from [class 1](classroom_materials/class_01/class_01.md)
 - Highly recommended:
   - GitHub and VS Code:
     - Watch the Youtube series: [Using GitHub with Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tn58KQvWtU&list=PLpPVLI0A0OkLBWbcctmGxxF6VHWSQw1hi)
     - Set up a GitHub with your studygroup and discover/resolve any issues you might have
   - Live Share
     - Watch video: [Live Share with Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ck2QhMxAYg)
     - Set up a live share session with your studygroup and discover/resolve any issues you might have

## Download models for Stanza
Before class you should have downloaded the Danish and English model for Stanford's NLP library Stanza. If you don't have stanza installed see [class 1](classroom_materials/class_01/class_01.md).

For a guide on downloading stanza models follow these step for a bit more control (or if you have any issues) see their online [guide](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/download_models.html):
- Open your python editor of choice
- Run the following:

```Python
import stanza
stanza.download('en')
stanza.download('da')
```

## Github with Visual Studio Code
So instead of spending time in introducing GitHub in class. I recommend everyone check out Youtube series: [Using GitHub with Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tn58KQvWtU&list=PLpPVLI0A0OkLBWbcctmGxxF6VHWSQw1hi). It should go over the most important aspects. I recommmend you also try creating a GitHub with your studygroup and spent time resolving any issues. 


As always you are free to use git however you like just so long that you are able to collaborate with your studygroup online. This is important given that future classes might end up taking place online due to Covid-19.


## Live Share with Visual Studio Code
So instead of spending time in introducing Live Share in class. I recommend everyone check out the video: [Live Share with Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ck2QhMxAYg), which should give you a decent introduction. I recommmend you starting a session with your studygroup and see if you can:

1) See what eachother is working on 
2) Run code
3) See the result of code run by others
4) Open script located in the folder on the sharing parts laptop


As always you are free to not use Live Share just so long that you are able to collaborate with your studygroup online. This is important given that future classes might end up taking place online due to Covid-19.
