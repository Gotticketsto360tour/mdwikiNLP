Note: Changes to this plan may occur

### TL:DR
 - Required:
   - Make sure you have download the Danish and English model for Stanza prior to class (see [class 2](classroom_materials/class_02/class_02.md))


 - Recommended: 
   - Download and set up [Kite](https://www.kite.com)

## Plan for Class
We will continue where we left of in the previous class.

## Kite
[Kite](https://www.kite.com) is an intelligent autocomplete for Python. It contains a short tutorial when installed. As it is very short I recommend going through it. Kite is free and you can even use their pro license with if you create a user using a valid AU email.


<!--

Go through at the start of class:
Kite - example of docs and autocomplete

* writing more structured scripts
* do something with ngrams (e.g. exercises from nltk book chapter 1)
* basic frequency stats?
* make sure they understand python classes before next week
